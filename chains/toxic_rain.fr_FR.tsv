mm4mn8	Your ship's sensors detect an incoming small meteorite
09ef1z	“Probably a false positive again... Maybe one day I'll fix that damn sensor...” [ignore it]
i3wplb	“Alright, I will look at it, but only this one last time!!”
ewdh0r	The meteorite is little and composed of rock and ice, it will disintegrate in the atmosphere, nothing to worry about. - You're not sure if the planetary collision-detection system should filter out these harmless objets. You don't remember how you configured it back in the time, and of course this is not documented.
g4ri5x	The meteorite is in reality a chemicals container ! - Some company probably rocketed it to the sky instead of paying to destroy it safely
wn0js2	Try to guide the population to a safe area
iu508m	“They'll be fine“ [do nothing]
hf45zz	The meteorite seems to be a toxic container, we have an issue!
kec5jv	“No meteorite in sight eh? I'm losing my time with these sensors...“
wy6op2	The meteorite disintegrates while entering the atmosphere.
a2sqrm	When reaching the atmosphere, the container disintegrates, causing a toxic rain.
bcy1ze	Your population followed your path and dodged the toxic rain
an4d3l	Unfortunately, your population did not follow your path to dodge the toxic rain
