dcaadq	Your 'Ecology balance simulation' shows that the current balance in the area of your species is lower than estimated. - You think that your deployed drones are disturbing local wildlife, maybe a stealth upgrade for the drones could be a good idea. You could order it right away and hope for a fast delivery.
y9zg0n	“Oh, there is a discount on the MIL-SPEC model! This module is even invisible to most sensors and emits customizable noise-canceling waves!“ [300 €€€]
0hnn4k	“WHAT?! All that money for a basic sound emitter and a smart holographic display, this is a scam! The cheapest one, used, on a weird discount platform, will do just fine.“ [95 €€€]
gsfd6m	“I'm not sure the simulation is even well calibrated, better spend money elsewhere.“
fg7i5z	The drone stealth upgrade arrived, you start deploying it, and it's so satisfying to manipulate such quality product - With some tests trying different combinations, you notice that some local species you thought were fearful by nature, were actually terrified about the atrocious sound the drones were making! - The upgrade had a better positive impact on the ecology than expected! “I knew this beautiful piece of hardware would not fail me.“
cqh8ks	The drone stealth upgrade arrived, you start deploying it, right after spending hours fighting with the installation manual - The ecology is getting better, but you're not sure why.
rxkov6	You do not try to upgrade your drones.
rp03hu	The drone stealth upgrade arrived, the installation manual is covered with some unknown fluids, and the module stops working after only 10 hours being deployed. “These damn space scammers!!“
