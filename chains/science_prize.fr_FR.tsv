tdm01o	You receive a spacemail with the following object: “Congratulations!!!! Grand science prize©®”
ztmwyt	“My inbox is filled with spam like that. What did I even install a filter for?”
ju866f	“Actual scientists like me don't have time to waste on frivolous things like that.”
k1xdmb	“It doesn't hurt to take a look. Maybe that prize comes with some cash.”
k4bq3y	“My work is too mediocre to deserve any prize. I won't tempt fate and get disappointed.”
3o71vm	You read the content of the spacemail, which contains lots of blinking gifs in addition to the text: Congratulations!!!! The jury of the Grand science prize©® has selected YOU to be one of the nominees of our next edition. Everybody here will be overjoyed when you accept this fantastic opportunity to advance your career. Your contributions to important science topics have really, really impressed us. You'll find all the information about the venue attached to this spacemail.
vbe09n	To participate, you simply have to pay very modest inscription fees (20€) to the bank account whose info you'll also find attached.
q7nwtn	“Guess I got what I deserve for hoping this wouldn't be spam.”
jb2m95	“They can't seriously expect me to pay for a so-called “Grand science prize” I never heard about before. Scammers these days...”
obido1	“I'm not a fan of how they worded their invite but you should never judge a book by its cover. I'll go!”
ftcajt	“They seem laid back and friendly! I'll be happy to go!”
0h35li	“Who do they think they are? I'm busy doing some actual work here, no way I go to their event if they can't even pretend to have an ounce of seriousness and professional behavior in them.”

4v7e0n	You delete the spacemail.
rx606i	Just as you accept the invite, you get another spacemail from the Grand science prize organization. Apparently they've mixed up some names, and you're not even nominated. You can't help but feel slightly insulted that once again your work won't really be appreciated.
e9jzpl	It's time for you to go to the Grand science prize event. Hopefully your nomination will become a win! The event conveniently takes place not so far from the planet you work on - it's on a space station only 4 systems away.
xvurre	After some trouble finding the room for the event inside the station, you enter it only to realize there's only about half a dozen people inside, with some mismatched chairs and a meager buffet on some tables.One person from the group, wearing the most brightly colored suit you've ever seen, notices you and says: “Oh, I think everybody's here! I'm so happy everyone could make it. Let's get started!” They keep talking for over half an hour, with the most mundane and boring speech about science you've ever heard. You're about to doze off when finally the winner of the event is announced.
ibdyoq	Finally!
shay00	Congratulations! You can come back to your workplace with a certificate printed on flimsy paper, two encyclopedias about spacemushrooms, and a measly cashprize. At least you didn't completely waste your time like the other, less lucky nominees!
dz20sv	You didn't win, but considering the prize turns out to consist of three coupons to buy books at a library specialized in spacemushrooms, you didn't lose that much either - if you don't think about all the time you wasted here!
qsz897	The event takes place in the biggest auditorium of the station - hundreds of scientists and scholars are already there. You socialize for a bit until the event properly begins. After a quick introduction speech, the results are in.
3zzue0	Finally!
e76fwg	Congratulations, you've won the grand prize! You get on stage and thank your team and the prize jury. The prize in itself is nice, but the hefty sum of money that comes with it doesn't hurt either!
447qrz	Some other team won the grand prize, for their supposedly revolutionary research on spacemushrooms. You get an honorable mention though - and it comes with a small cash prize which is still enough to prevent you from being sad!
xkx49v	You hoped to hear your name, but you're not even part of the honorable mentions. Well, at least the food from the catering was really good, so who cares if the jury preferred a study about spacemushrooms over yours?
