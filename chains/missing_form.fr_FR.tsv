3vq8s7	On a unusually calm Tuesday morning, you read through your spacemails and find one from an obscure administration you've never heard about - the PETTEE (Planetoid and Exoplanet Tenaciously Tactical Executive Embassy).
3irnqn	They complain about some form you were supposed to fill before being allowed to deploy a new species to the planet - one where you accept to be liable if any specimen of the species is found on another planet in the future. They're threatening you of legal repercussions if you don't pay penalties and fill the form immediately.
p4c1co	“That's obviously a scam!” [ignore it]
t9vme0	“I'm pretty sure they're bluffing about these penalty to scare me into paying them. I'll just fill their form.”
stpcoi	“I can't stand losing time with any administration. I'll fill their form and pay the penalties.”
hdyq1g	It's been a while since you haven't had news from the PETTEE administration which was asking you to pay a fee for a missing form. Either it was an actual scam or maybe they're so disorganized they've forgotten about you.
be3f0c	You receive another spacemail from PETTEE, that allegedly legitimate administration who wanted you to pay them and fill a form.
1laph0	“These scammers don't give up easily, I'll give them that.” [keep ignoring their demands]
6jsb2u	“Maybe they're actually legit… I'd better do as they say.”
ma8h5k	Pretend you've filled the form after the first warning.
vrtsnh	You pay the fine and fill the form.
i1ukfv	You receive a call from your manager, who sounds… angry, to say the least. “What do you mean you haven't filled the PETTEE form? Everybody knows this is like the first thing to do when introducing a new species to a planetoid or an exoplanet! Do you also need me to check if you introduced a carnivorous species to a completely vegetal world? Just pay the dang fine and send them their form or I swear to God…”
wbaedd	You soon receive a call from your manager, who sounds… angry, to say the least. “Tell me why I'm getting calls from PETTEE about you lying that you've filled a form when their records clearly show it's not the case? Even interns know filling that form is like the first thing to do when introducing a new species to a planetoid or an exoplanet! Do you also need me to check if you introduced a carnivorous species to a completely vegetal world? Just pay the dang fine and send them their form or I swear to God…”
0nduhg	You soon hear from an obviously very laid-back clerk from PETTEE. “Hey pal, seems like we've lost that form or whatevs, send it again plz”
gpx3i4	[Fill the form - seems like they've forgotten the fine]
r9bpix	[Pay the fine and fill the form]
71xs1e	PETTEE seems to have forgotten about you since you filled their form, even though you didn't pay their fine.
0ce8s9	PETTEE seems to have completely forgotten about you even though you neither filled their form nor payed their fine.
7lmu4o	You hear back from PETTEE. They acknowledge they've received the form but are still waiting for the payment of the fine. “*Sigh* I've underestimated them…”
e4dutw	You pay the fine after all.
