7kv2vq	You're contacted by some employees of very, very wealthy people. Their bosses are avid hunters and would be willing to pay loads of cash to be the first hunters of the species you're taking care of.
fbxjd0	“I guess just a fewer specimens won't hurt in the long run.”
nmzvao	“What? Who do they think they are? I won't let them undo all my hard work!”
785iko	You receive the payment. A few days pass before the hunters get on the planet and successfully hunt down 10 specimens of your species.
3cic55	You receive the payment. A few days pass before the hunters get on the planet. It turns out they aren't as good hunters as they think they are - they couldn't capture even juvenile specimens and some of them are actually wounded.
nthjmx	Pretend nothing has happened while they shamefully enter the medical bay
4nz2up	Praise them for being so skilled at “tactical retreat”
sykd2f	Try to blackmail them - either they become “generous donators” or everybody will know about just how poor hunters they are
gbpskd	You never hear of the hunters again.
vifsix	The rich hunters tell you how they'd like to hunt your species again.
7u9jw6	They immediately get back to you with an offer twice as generous.
m8zohf	“On second thought...”
dmjohd	“Typical rich people reaction. Throwing money at the problem won't help them here though.”
yq9ox0	They're so worried about appearing manly that they accept. You get another 100 credits.
4tfjer	As soon as you finish insinuating your intentions, a lawyer appears and offers you a detailed explanation of how that would be a very, very bad idea for you.
